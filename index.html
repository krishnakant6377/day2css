    <h3>1. What is box sizing?</h3>
<p><b> Ans.</b> Box-sizing property defines how the width and height gets applied on an element.
                Default value of box-sizing is content-box, in this case the actual width of the box
                will be equal to the border and padding and width of the box ( Actual width : width
                + border + padding ).</p>
               <p> In case when box-sizing is set to be border-box, then the actual width will be equal
                to the width of the box itself. Means if we will increase the padding or border of
                the box then it will not increase the width of the box.</p>
    <ol type="1">
   <li> content-box (Default)</li>
    <li> border-box</li>
 </ol>
<h3>2. What is animation delay?</h3>
<p><b> Ans.</b> It is a sub-property of CSS animation. It defines how long the animation has to
    wait before starting. Using the animation-delay property, you define the delay by
    specifying the number of seconds or milliseconds it should take before playing.
</p>

<h3>3.Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?</h3>
<p><b> Ans.</b>  <b> grid-column-start and grid-column-end property</b> can be used to merge cells
    vertically. It also has a shorthand i.e., grid-column: start/end. If you want to merge
    two elements in row then we will have to use grid-row property inside the child
    element. Remember these properties are applicable only to child elements not to
    parent elements.
</p>

<h3>4. Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid?</h3>
<p><b> Ans.</b> grid-row-start and grid-row-end property can be used to merge cells horizontally. </p>
<p>It also has a shorthand i.e., grid-row: grid-row-start/grid-row-end;</p>
<h3>5. what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?</h3>
<p><b> Ans.</b> display: none;</p>
   <p></p>● The display: none property is used to hide elements without deleting them. It
    does not take up any space.</p> 
    <p></p> ● In this case, the tag is removed from the page, which allows other elements
    to fill in.</p> 
    <p>visibility: hidden;</p> 
    <p>  ● The visibility: hidden property also hides an element, but affects the layout
    i.e., it takes up the space.</p> 
    <p> ● The element is hidden from view but not the page flow</p>
